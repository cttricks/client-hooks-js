# Client Hook JS

Welcome to **Client Hook JS**! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

**Client Hook JS** is a lightweight library designed for managing global state and reactive effects in JavaScript applications. Itâ€™s a tool I created primarily for learning purposes and to use in my personal projects. The library provides a simple way to manage global state and handle side effects, akin to React hooks but with a global scope.

## Features

- **Global State Management**: Define and manage global state variables with the `useState()` function.
- **Reactive Effects**: Register and handle side effects based on state changes using the `useEffect()` function.

## Installation

To use **Client Hook JS** in your project, simply include the file `lib/*-min.js` or `lib/*-app.js` in your project directory and import it into your JavaScript files.

## Usage

### `useState(name, value)`

Creates a global state variable with a specified name and initial value. Allows retrieval and updating of the state from anywhere in your code.

### `useEffect(callback, variables)`

Registers a callback function to be executed whenever any of the specified state variables change. The callback is called immediately with the current values of these variables and is triggered on subsequent updates.

### Automatic `HTML Updates`

If you declare the client-hook attribute on an HTML element, such as:

```html
<h1 client-hook="count"></h1>
```

When the value of the count state variable changes, the `<h1>` tag will automatically update to reflect the new value of count. This provides a simple way to bind HTML elements to global state without needing additional code to manually update the DOM.

## Example
